Getting onto the aircraft in Nairobi was chaotic with no priority given to business passengers \\u2013 for the airline \\u2018Sky Priority\\u2019 means nothing. From the boarding gate we then went on a long bus journey around the airport before returning to part of the terminal to climb up stairs to get onto the aircraft. Although the cabin crew were very pleasant and offered a pre-flight drink (champagne, water or apple juice) no more drinks were served until after the meal arrived. This was a total disappointment with my beef option consisting of two small pieces of beef, some sauce and a mini samosa. It was complemented with a glass of wine in a thimble-sized glass which was only refilled when we asked the crew. One of the mysteries of the flight was why the lavatory at the front of the aircraft permanently had an engaged light on. When we asked we were told that the captain had said that it was \\u2018reserved for the crew and passengers could not use it\\u2019. Another mystery was a man who spent the entire flight sat on the crew jumpseat in the middle of the business section. I asked him what he was doing and he explained that the crew \\u2018could not find me anywhere to sit\\u2019. Given that airlines flying into the UK have a legal obligation to provide advance passenger information 24-hours before arrival it would be interesting to know how this requirement was met. Although the aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth, Kenya Airways\\u2019 787 are let down by their old-style side-by-side seating which was worn and, in some cases, not functioning properly. The fact that the flight was full suggests that the airline has no problem selling tickets and therefore little incentive to improve its product.\",\n          \"They misplaced my bag. I filled a form at Heathrow airport and that was it. I waited for days for calls nothing until I finally found their UK line and i called them and they kept telling me to hold on. Eventually they sent a bag but it was another person\\u2019s bag. I called that my should be brought and the other be returned. I told them I wouldn\\u2019t release the bag until my bag is sent and i am not comfortable with having someone\\u2019s property with me. Then i was told the true owner of the bag is in Dubai and my bag is with them at Nairobi and a \\u201cpicture\\u201d of a wrapped bag (I didn\\u2019t wrap my bag) was sent. Another 2 weeks and nothing has been done again. Customer service is totally rude this time. Kept complaining to them that all my clothes are in that bag and I have no winter cloth to wear here but they aren\\u2019t even ready to help\",\n          \"Kigali via Nairobi to Dar November 23; 2 short regional flights; first on a B738; next on Embraer 190. Benefitted a lot by being a Skyteam gold card holder: got the best seats and access to lounges in Kigali, Dar, Nairobi which all are good, varied with improved hot food options. Boarding easy and quick. Onboard, enjoyed special meals pre-ordered and given on both flights; an impressive gesture. Skyteam priority worked to some extend. Onboard, not recognised as elite status holder, but cannot complain as we were fairly well pampered. Call bell was answered if running short. 1st flight had serious landing attempts in Nairobi before succeeding. Worst nightmare was a repeated delay on flight NBO-DAR. A technical issue reoccurred even on a substituted aircraft instated. Eventually we took off but upon worries expressed by captain, we became forced to return back to Nairobi, despite we were almost already at Dar. 150 passengers then had to sit in the aircraft or debark into a bus on the tarmac in Nairobi. There were no proper announcements, no service, no toilet access, just waiting in limbo for hours. Some passengers refused to reboard as they lost faith in the airline and aircraft. Then these passengers luggage had to be offloaded, another hour went by. The whole night was completely destroyed; however, at last we took off but only arrived in Dar early morning instead of at midnight as scheduled. Five hours delay is serious and favour direct flights avoiding transits. The good thing was that we, and luggage as well, finally arrived and in one piece. For both flights, FAs and passengers were in general cooperative, extrovert, and sociable.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Getting onto the aircraft in Nairobi was chaotic with no priority given to business passengers \\u2013 for the airline \\u2018Sky Priority\\u2019 means nothing. From the boarding gate we then went on a long bus journey around the airport before returning to part of the terminal to climb up stairs to get onto the aircraft. Although the cabin crew were very pleasant and offered a pre-flight drink (champagne, water or apple juice) no more drinks were served until after the meal arrived. This was a total disappointment with my beef option consisting of two small pieces of beef, some sauce and a mini samosa. It was complemented with a glass of wine in a thimble-sized glass which was only refilled when we asked the crew. One of the mysteries of the flight was why the lavatory at the front of the aircraft permanently had an engaged light on. When we asked we were told that the captain had said that it was \\u2018reserved for the crew and passengers could not use it\\u2019. Another mystery was a man who spent the entire flight sat on the crew jumpseat in the middle of the business section. I asked him what he was doing and he explained that the crew \\u2018could not find me anywhere to sit\\u2019. Given that airlines flying into the UK have a legal obligation to provide advance passenger information 24-hours before arrival it would be interesting to know how this requirement was met. Although the aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth, Kenya Airways\\u2019 787 are let down by their old-style side-by-side seating which was worn and, in some cases, not functioning properly. The fact that the flight was full suggests that the airline has no problem selling tickets and therefore little incentive to improve its product.\",\n          \"They misplaced my bag. I filled a form at Heathrow airport and that was it. I waited for days for calls nothing until I finally found their UK line and i called them and they kept telling me to hold on. Eventually they sent a bag but it was another person\\u2019s bag. I called that my should be brought and the other be returned. I told them I wouldn\\u2019t release the bag until my bag is sent and i am not comfortable with having someone\\u2019s property with me. Then i was told the true owner of the bag is in Dubai and my bag is with them at Nairobi and a \\u201cpicture\\u201d of a wrapped bag (I didn\\u2019t wrap my bag) was sent. Another 2 weeks and nothing has been done again. Customer service is totally rude this time.

Benefitted a lot by being a Skyteam gold card holder: got the best seats and access to lounges in Kigali, Dar, Nairobi which all are good, varied with improved hot food options. Boarding easy and quick. Onboard, enjoyed special meals pre-ordered and given on both flights; an impressive gesture. Skyteam priority worked to some extend. Onboard, not recognised as elite status holder, but cannot complain as we were fairly well pampered. Call bell was answered if running short. 1st flight had serious landing attempts in Nairobi before succeeding. Worst nightmare was a repeated delay on flight NBO-DAR. A technical issue reoccurred even on a substituted aircraft instated. Eventually we took off but upon worries expressed by captain, we became forced to return back to Nairobi, despite we were almost already at Dar. 150 passengers then had to sit in the aircraft or debark into a bus on the tarmac in Nairobi. There were no proper announcements, no service, no toilet access, just waiting in limbo for hours. Some passengers refused to reboard as they lost faith in the airline and aircraft. Then these passengers luggage had to be offloaded, another hour went by. The whole night was completely destroyed; however, at last we took off but only arrived in Dar early morning instead of at midnight as scheduled. Five hours delay is serious and favour direct flights avoiding transits. The good thing was that we, and luggage as well, finally arrived and in one piece. For both flights, FAs and passengers were in general cooperative, extrovert, and sociable.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Getting onto the aircraft in Nairobi was chaotic with no priority given to business passengers \\u2013 for the airline \\u2018Sky Priority\\u2019 means nothing. From the boarding gate we then went on a long bus journey around the airport before returning to part of the terminal to climb up stairs to get onto the aircraft. Although the cabin crew were very pleasant and offered a pre-flight drink (champagne, water or apple juice) no more drinks were served until after the meal arrived. This was a total disappointment with my beef option consisting of two small pieces of beef, some sauce and a mini samosa. It was complemented with a glass of wine in a thimble-sized glass which was only refilled when we asked the crew. One of the mysteries of the flight was why the lavatory at the front of the aircraft permanently had an engaged light on. When we asked we were told that the captain had said that it was \\u2018reserved for the crew and passengers could not use it\\u2019. Another mystery was a man who spent the entire flight sat on the crew jumpseat in the middle of the business section. I asked him what he was doing and he explained that the crew \\u2018could not find me anywhere to sit\\u2019. Given that airlines flying into the UK have a legal obligation to provide advance passenger information 24-hours before arrival it would be interesting to know how this requirement was met. Although the aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth, Kenya Airways\\u2019 787 are let down by their old-style side-by-side seating which was worn and, in some cases, not functioning properly. The fact that the flight was full suggests that the airline has no problem selling tickets and therefore little incentive to improve its product.\",\n          \"Customer service is totally rude They misplaced my bag. I filled a form at Heathrow airport and that was it. I waited for days for calls nothing until I finally found their UK line and i called them and they kept telling me to hold on. Eventually they sent a bag but it was another person\\u2019s bag. I called that my should be brought and the other be returned. I told them I wouldn\\u2019t release the bag until my bag is sent and i am not comfortable with having someone\\u2019s property with me. Then i was told the true owner of the bag is in Dubai and my bag is with them at Nairobi and a \\u201cpicture\\u201d of a wrapped bag (I didn\\u2019t wrap my bag) was sent. Another 2 weeks and nothing has been done again. Customer service is totally rude this time. Kept complaining to them that all my clothes are in that bag and I have no winter cloth to wear here but they aren\\u2019t even ready to help\",\n          \"Five hours delay is serious Kigali via Nairobi to Dar November 23; 2 short regional flights; first on a B738; next on Embraer 190. Benefitted a lot by being a Skyteam gold card holder: got the best seats and access to lounges in Kigali, Dar, Nairobi which all are good, varied with improved hot food options. Boarding easy and quick. Onboard, enjoyed special meals pre-ordered and given on both flights; an impressive gesture. Skyteam priority worked to some extend. Onboard, not recognised as elite status holder, but cannot complain as we were fairly well pampered. Call bell was answered if running short. 1st flight had serious landing attempts in Nairobi before succeeding. Worst nightmare was a repeated delay on flight NBO-DAR. A technical issue reoccurred even on a substituted aircraft instated. Eventually we took off but upon worries expressed by captain, we became forced to return back to Nairobi, despite we were almost already at Dar. 150 passengers then had to sit in the aircraft or debark into a bus on the tarmac in Nairobi. There were no proper announcements, no service, no toilet access, just waiting in limbo for hours. Some passengers refused to reboard as they lost faith in the airline and aircraft. Then these passengers luggage had to be offloaded, another hour went by. The whole night was completely destroyed; however, at last we took off but only arrived in Dar early morning instead of at midnight as scheduled. Five hours delay is serious and favour direct flights avoiding transits. The good thing was that we, and luggage as well, finally arrived and in one piece. For both flights, FAs and passengers were in general cooperative, extrovert, and sociable.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Getting onto the aircraft in Nairobi was chaotic with no priority given to business passengers \\u2013 for the airline \\u2018Sky Priority\\u2019 means nothing. From the boarding gate we then went on a long bus journey around the airport before returning to part of the terminal to climb up stairs to get onto the aircraft. Although the cabin crew were very pleasant and offered a pre-flight drink (champagne, water or apple juice) no more drinks were served until after the meal arrived. This was a total disappointment with my beef option consisting of two small pieces of beef, some sauce and a mini samosa. It was complemented with a glass of wine in a thimble-sized glass which was only refilled when we asked the crew. One of the mysteries of the flight was why the lavatory at the front of the aircraft permanently had an engaged light on. When we asked we were told that the captain had said that it was \\u2018reserved for the crew and passengers could not use it\\u2019. Another mystery was a man who spent the entire flight sat on the crew jumpseat in the middle of the business section. I asked him what he was doing and he explained that the crew \\u2018could not find me anywhere to sit\\u2019. Given that airlines flying into the UK have a legal obligation to provide advance passenger information 24-hours before arrival it would be interesting to know how this requirement was met. Although the aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth, Kenya Airways\\u2019 787 are let down by their old-style side-by-side seating which was worn and, in some cases, not functioning properly. The fact that the flight was full suggests that the airline has no problem selling tickets and therefore little incentive to improve its product.\",\n          \"Customer service is totally rude They misplaced my bag. I filled a form at Heathrow airport and that was it. I waited for days for calls nothing until I finally found their UK line and i called them and they kept telling me to hold on. Eventually they sent a bag but it was another person\\u2019s bag. I called that my should be brought and the other be returned. I told them I wouldn\\u2019t release the bag until my bag is sent and i am not comfortable with having someone\\u2019s property with me. Then i was told the true owner of the bag is in Dubai and my bag is with them at Nairobi and a \\u201cpicture\\u201d of a wrapped bag (I didn\\u2019t wrap my bag) was sent. Another 2 weeks and nothing has been done again. Customer service is totally rude this time. Kept complaining to them that all my clothes are in that bag and I have no winter cloth to wear here but they aren\\u2019t even ready to help\",\n          \"Five hours delay is serious Kigali via Nairobi to Dar November 23; 2 short regional flights; first on a B738; next on Embraer 190. Benefitted a lot by being a Skyteam gold card holder: got the best seats and access to lounges in Kigali, Dar, Nairobi which all are good, varied with improved hot food options. Boarding easy and quick. Onboard, enjoyed special meals pre-ordered and given on both flights; an impressive gesture. Skyteam priority worked to some extend. Onboard, not recognised as elite status holder, but cannot complain as we were fairly well pampered. Call bell was answered if running short. 1st flight had serious landing attempts in Nairobi before succeeding. Worst nightmare was a repeated delay on flight NBO-DAR. A technical issue reoccurred even on a substituted aircraft instated. Eventually we took off but upon worries expressed by captain, we became forced to return back to Nairobi, despite we were almost already at Dar. 150 passengers then had to sit in the aircraft or debark into a bus on the tarmac in Nairobi. There were no proper announcements, no service, no toilet access, just waiting in limbo for hours. Some passengers refused to reboard as they lost faith in the airline and aircraft. Then these passengers luggage had to be offloaded, another hour went by. The whole night was completely destroyed; however, at last we took off but only arrived in Dar early morning instead of at midnight as scheduled. Five hours delay is serious and favour direct flights avoiding transits. The good thing was that we, and luggage as well, finally arrived and in one piece. For both flights, FAs and passengers were in general cooperative, extrovert, and sociable.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"roberta_neg\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 470,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6462950110435486,\n          0.9227840304374695,\n          0.20973581075668335\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"roberta_neu\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 470,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.31151774525642395,\n          0.0700954794883728,\n          0.4268578588962555\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"roberta_pos\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 470,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.04218723624944687,\n          0.00712042348459363,\n          0.36340630054473877\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"overall_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 470,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6462950110435486,\n          0.9227840304374695,\n          0.4268578588962555\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"negative\",\n          \"neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
